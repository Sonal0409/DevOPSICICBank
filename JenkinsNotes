Delivery Pipeline in Jenkins

*******************************

Jenkins--> Manage Jenkins-->Global Tool configuration

Go to JDK section
In this give:
1. Uncheck -- install automatically
2. JDK name as myjava
3. Go to server type 
# echo $JAVA_HOME ==> will give java location
JAVA_HOME =
/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.265.b01-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64

Save it.

Under GIT==> leave it same 

Under maven ==> lets install it automatically
Type mymaven and check the install automatically box.
Save the changes


****************************************

CREATION OF COMPILE JOB
***********************************

1. new Job --complie-->freestyle project
2. Source code management --> select git
--->give git path ===> https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes.git

3. build ==> select invoke top level maven targets
   select maven version===> mymaven
    goal ==> compile
4. save ==> build now 
So all the compiled files will be present at this location
==> look for this line in console output at the end on jenkins
Compiling 13 source files to /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/compile1/target/classes

5. Go to workspace on the left side of jenkins Job compile
In the folder go to ==> target folder==> go to classes/com/edurekademo
==> click on edurekademo==> got to utilities==> all class files will be there which have recently been compiled.
******************************
2nd JOB ==>Code Review
*********************

Jenkins--> new item--> Name= code Review==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> 
give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes

Step 2: build ==> invoke top level maven target==>
 select maven version==>mymaven ==> goal = pmd:pmd

save==> build now
==> click on build number and see the console

Goto Workspace on the left side of jenkins Job code review
In the folder go to ==> target folder ==> you will find pmd.xml file.

CONVERT FILE TO TREND REPORT
*******************************
 manage jenkins--> manage plugins--> available --> Search for pmd plugin--> install it.

Now go to the job Code Review==> go to post build actions ==> select Publish PMD anaylsys report

under PMD results==> give path of pmd.xml file ie:  target/pmd.xml

Save the file and build now.

After the build is successfull, you will see PMD Warnings

So you will see 12 new warning have been generated on the code.
Scroll down 
Under package click on first one to check warnings.

*********************************
JOB3: Testing --Unit Test report
********************************

1. jenkins--> new item--> Name= unitTest==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes

2. build ==> invoke top level maven target==> select maven version==>mymaven ==> goal = test

3. Save and Build now.

4. Check the workspace

5. surefire-reports will be present

But we cannot understand them easily. So lets generate understandable reports by using Junit reports option under post build actions

6. Go back to job==> post build actions==> select junit test result job
==> give target/surefire-reports/*.xml  ===>under test report xml
This is path where xml files are there.
Here *.xml is as we want to use all the xml files

7. Save and build again

Go to build number ===> on left side you will see Test Result 
Click on it and you can see all pass and fail details of the tests

**************************
JOB4 : Metric check
************************

1. Go to jenkins--> new item--> Name= Metriccheck==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes

2.  build ==> invoke top level maven target==> select mymaven
    goal = cobertura:cobertura -Dcobertura.report.format=xml

3.==> save==> build now
==> click on build number and see the console

4. go to Workspace ==> target/site/cobertura/coverage.xml  

The xml file will be there, But we cannot understand them easily. So lets generate understandable reports by downloading cobertura plugin

Go to manage jenkins--> manage plugins--> cobertura --> install it

Go back to the job--> post build actions--> select publish cobertura coverage report
Under cobertura xml pattern give ==> target/site/cobertura/coverage.xml   ==> you can take the path from below displayed text.

Save and build again
Click build number ==> on left side you will find Coverage Report==> click on it ==> we cna see the coverage report.

**********************************
Job5 Package Job
***************************

Go to jenkins--> new item--> Name= Package==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes
 
build ==> invoke top level maven target==>mymaven

 goal = package

==> save==> build now
==> click on build number and see the console

==> go to workspace ==> target/addressbook.war

Connecting all the 5 jobs so that each job can be triggered:

******************************
Pipeline as a code
**************************
Lets create a pipeline using code:

Create 1 job and add multiple task (using code) in the job and run multiple tasks in 1 job

This code is written using pipeline DSL(domain specific language]
It is derieved using groovy


Create a new job ==> select project as pipeline


pipeline{
    tools{
        jdk 'myjava'
        maven 'mymaven'
    }
    agent any
    stages{
        stage('checkout'){
            steps{
                git 'https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes.git'
            }
        }
        stage('compile'){
            steps{
                sh 'mvn compile'
            }
        }
        stage('codeReview'){
            steps{
                sh 'mvn pmd:pmd'
            }
        }
        stage('unitTest'){
            steps{
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('metricCheck'){
            steps{
                sh 'mvn cobertura:cobertura -Dcobertura.report.format=xml'
            }
        }
        stage('package'){
            steps{
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
            
        }

    }

Scenario 1: 

Adding Linux slave to jenkins master over ssh

*************

Start the master machine

Start the linux slave

 Install git 

 > yum install git -y

Install java
 
> yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

Install maven

 > yum install maven -y


Connect Master to slave

*****

Step 1: Configure tools ===> and the chnage jenkins URL

Step 2:  go to configure global security ==> Scroll down to Agent ==>provide Agent port ==> select Random

Step 3: Manage nodes and clouds

Configuration of Agent - 3 important points:
****************
1. You need to give the path of the directory on Agent where workspace has to created by master

On the Agent - perform these steps

   > create an empty directory on slave
   > note the path of the directory :  /tmp/jenkinsdir20
   > give read write execute permissions to the directory

On the master -- give the path of the directory



2. label : giving a tag to the slave

  QA -- 3 servers ==> label all of them as QA_slave

 On the job you will specify label so as to execute it on the agent ==> execute on QA_slave


3. launch or connect to the slave


 ==> if it is linux slave connect using SSH

 ==> give the private ip of the slave under HOST

 ===> credentials

    ==> username & password on slave and connect using it through jenkins

 OR

  ==> you can use username and AWS pem key to connect
 
       > Select SSH username and private key

give id => id20
give description ==> linux_slave20

username ==> ec2-user

AddKey ==> add here


go to AWS ==> on the linux slave see the key name on extreme right

go to downloads folder of your machine --> search the key file and open it with notepad

==> copy the contents of the notepad and paste it on the master user ENTER DIRECTLY

==> save 

Select the credentials form the drop down now


Host Key Verification Strategy ==> Non verifying verification startegy



Availability ==> keep this agent online as much as possible

Nodes ==> select tool locations

give location for git ==> /usr/bin/git

give localtion for java ===>  /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.302.b08-0.amzn2.0.1.x86_64


And save the configuration.

Slave will connect to master successfully
